I've
heard.
Even
if
you
do
the
assignment
correctly,
he'll
fail
you
just
because
he's
in
a
bad
mood.
Whenever
he's
in
a
bad
mood,
good
luck
because
he
just
loves
to
screw
people
over.
All
he
brags
about
is
his
navy
experience.
Not

to,

as
much
as
you
can.

He
gives
quizzes
every

about

slides,
so
if

I
took
425
during
an
online
covid
semester,
so
I
can't
speak
to
his
in-person
lecture.
However,
this
class
was
horrible.
Powell
thinks
he
is
always
right
and
the
way
he
describes
things
is
the
only
correct
way.
The
grading
was
harsh
and
unfair
(this
could
be
attributed
to
the
TA,
but
Powell
had
full
authority
over
the
grading

is
very

and
shows

He's
a

grader
is

He
will
take

points
regardless
for
the
sake
of
it.
Exams
are
tough,
but
that's
always
the
case
with
him,
since
he

that

on

to
adhere
to
